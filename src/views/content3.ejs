<h1>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</h1>
<p>
	I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things
	bring. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in
	his life.
</p>
<p>
	We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
	<strong> Fatal.</strong> <em> Shinier than yours, meatbag.</em> I don't want to be rescued.
</p>
<h2>
	Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine
	robot sisters are dating humans!
</h2>
<p>
	What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Say what? And remember, don't do anything that
	affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God,
	don't not do it!
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic
		beverages!
	</li>
	<li>Then we'll go with that data file!</li>
	<li>Leela's gonna kill me.</li>
</ol>

<h3>And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</h3>
<p>
	Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Really?!
	Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in
	Farnsworth's court!
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
	</li>
	<li>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</li>
	<li>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Bite my shiny metal ass. Man, I'm sore
	all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Is that a cooking show? Hey, tell
	me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your
	laundry?
</p>
<p>
	I'm a thing. You can see how I lived before I met you. You are the last hope of the universe.
	What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Noooooo!
</p>
<p>
	Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need
	someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you
	think? You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
</p>
<p>
	Really?! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting
	adults. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!
	Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
</p>
<p>
	You don't know how to do any of those. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked
	you to get busy! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break
	his legs? Look, last night was a mistake.
</p>
<p>
	All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm
	transferring to business school! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. And I'd do it again! And
	perhaps a third time! But that would be it.
</p>
<p>
	I had more, but you go ahead. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany,
	ambitious and misunderstood! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
	Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
</p>
<p>
	Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Or a guy who
	burns down a bar for the insurance money! Bite my shiny metal ass. With a warning label this
	big, you know they gotta be fun!
</p>
<p>
	You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Kids have names? Ok, we'll
	go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. What kind of a
	father would I be if I said no?
</p>
<p>
	I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! It's okay, Bender. I
	like cooking too. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. She also liked to shut up! Yes,
	except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
</p>
<p>
	I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
	I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I was
	all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!
